# Text Classification with Machine Learning

This project is a text classification task implemented in a Jupyter notebook using common machine learning and NLP libraries.

## Features
- Load and preprocess text data
- Feature extraction using CountVectorizer or other methods
- Model training and evaluation using supervised learning
- Prediction of new/unseen text

##  Libraries Used
- gensim, gensim.models, gensim.models.doc2vec, keras.layers, keras.models, keras.preprocessing.sequence, matplotlib.pyplot, nltk, nltk.corpus, numpy, pandas, re, seaborn, sklearn, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.model_selection, tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text, tqdm
## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `text_classification (1).ipynb`
2. Run the cells sequentially to load data, train model, and evaluate predictions.

##  Model Flow
- Text Preprocessing
- Feature Vectorization
- Model Fitting
- Accuracy and Metric Evaluation.
##  Notes
- Make sure all required libraries are installed
- Dataset is expected to be in CSV format with columns such as `text` and `label`
##  Author
This script was developed for demonstrating basic text classification pipeline using Python and scikit-learn.
